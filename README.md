# python_challenge

I have completed 2 different tasks in this challenge using Python.

For the first task, I utilized Python to perform the following calculations with the provided dataset:

  1. Determine the total number of months included in the dataset.
  2. Calculate the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
  3. Compute the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and subsequently find the average of those changes.
  4. Identify the greatest increase in profits (date and corresponding amount) over the entire period.
  5. Identify the greatest decrease in profits (date and corresponding amount) over the entire period.

  Finally, I exported the above results into a text file and pushed any changes to GitHub.

In the second task, I was provided with a voting count progress dataset and carried out the following analyses:

  1. Calculated the total number of votes cast.
  2. Compiled a comprehensive list of candidates who received votes.
  3. Determined the percentage of votes that each candidate won.
  4. Counted the total number of votes that each candidate received.
  5. Identified the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

  Afterward, I pushed the changes to GitHub.
